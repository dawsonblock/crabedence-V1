//! What an artifact *is*, before anything loads it.
//
//! Identity, hashing and manifest-relative resolution: the questions the kernel
//! asks about a plugin artifact without owning a way to run one. `plugin_artifact_identity`
//! is asked by the side that supervises a host process — before it starts one and
//! again while it runs — so it cannot live with the loader, and it needs nothing
//! the loader has.
//!
//! This module is deliberately the inert half of what used to be one file. The
//! loader next to it is the half that knows about `dlopen`, symbol tables and the
//! native ABI, and the two are being separated so that the loader can leave the
//! kernel's dependency graph without taking the kernel's own questions with it.
//!
//! Approval lives here too, and that placement is a decision rather than a
//! convenience: what a load is allowed to open is a decision about the artifact
//! rather than about loading it, so the composition that supervises a host makes it
//! here and the loader consumes the result. A verifier that lived with the loader
//! would be able to approve what it later opened, which is the thing the approval
//! exists to prevent.

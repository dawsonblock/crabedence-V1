//! The hosted-plugin seam, checked as the boundary it claims to be.
//!
//! `plugin/dynamic/hosted.rs` says what a hosted plugin's code may ask this
//! runtime to do, and the loader crate's `native.rs`/`host.rs` are the code that
//! does the asking. These tests hold the two together: the loader must not spell a
//! kernel item the seam replaced, every operation in the mapping must still be
//! called, and — the one that catches what nobody anticipated — the hosted side
//! must not name any other module-level kernel item that is not `pub` at all.
//!
//! They stayed in the kernel's crate on purpose when the loader moved out: the
//! seam and the operations are the kernel's, and a boundary is best checked from
//! the side that has to keep it.
//!
//! They live outside `src/` on purpose. A scan that has to write down declaration
//! keywords is a scan whose keyword list would otherwise be counted as part of the
//! kernel's textual `unsafe` budget, and inflating a security number to say
//! "the word appears in a test" is the kind of movement this repository's TCB
//! policy exists to prevent.

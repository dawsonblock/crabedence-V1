//! Stable contract for executing native plugins outside the kernel process.
//!
//! Native plugins are loaded by an unsafe dynamic loader, and that loader holds
//! almost all of the kernel's `unsafe`. Moving it into another crate inside the
//! same process would reorganise the source without moving the trust boundary: a
//! memory-corruption bug in the loader would still corrupt the kernel. The
//! destination is therefore a separate process reached through this contract —
//! the kernel owns the interface, the runtime supplies the implementation, and
//! dynamic loading happens on the far side of the boundary.
//!
//! This crate is the vocabulary only. It defines the operations, the identities
//! they act on, the structured failures, and the version handshake that lets a
//! mismatch fail closed. It deliberately ships no loader, no transport, and no
//! `unsafe`: the implementation stays where it is until the increment that moves
//! it can be reviewed on its own.
//!
//! The kernel depends on this crate, and on it only as an interface: the plugin
//! execution module names these types and enforces the deadline rule in front of
//! every backend, while the loader and the transport stay behind the boundary.

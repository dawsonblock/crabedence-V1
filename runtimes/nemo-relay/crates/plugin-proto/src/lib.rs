//! gRPC protocol for the out-of-process native plugin host.
//!
//! This crate is the single authority for what crosses the kernel↔host
//! boundary. `nemo-relay-plugin-protocol` holds the semantic vocabulary — the
//! domain types the kernel reasons about and the trait it calls — while this
//! crate holds the wire form of the same messages. Keeping them apart lets the
//! kernel depend on the vocabulary without taking on a protobuf toolchain, and
//! an architecture test keeps the wire from being declared anywhere else.
//!
//! The services are deliberately a pair. `PluginHost` is served by the host
//! process and answers the kernel's operations; `RelayRuntime` is served by the
//! kernel and answers the calls a running plugin makes back into it. A
//! request-only model cannot express the second direction, and the native ABI is
//! bidirectional: plugins are handed a table of host functions and the host
//! re-enters their callbacks.

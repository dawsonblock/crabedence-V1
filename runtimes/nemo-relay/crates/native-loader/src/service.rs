    // -- The Layer 2 gate: the three event sanitize families ---------------------

    // The classes under test are the mark, scope-start and scope-end sanitizers:
    // three families that share one serialization, and cross the boundary as a
    // *projection* — the identity a sanitizer decides on (the event's name, and the
    // phase when it is a scope event) plus the mutable observability fields it may
    // change. The kernel keeps the event, the class it asked under, the registration
    // identity, the operation identity and the publication decision.
    //
    // What is here is the host's half: exactly one registration runs, the class it
    // runs is the registration's own, and every failure is a failure rather than an
    // unsanitized answer. What is deliberately not here is the kernel's half — the
    // proxy that builds the projection, sends it beside the call and applies what
    // comes back — because a sanitize proxy's answer arrives over the composition's
    // own transport, so a test of it is a test with a host process in it. That
    // qualification is the process-boundary suite's, and it reuses the sentinel
    // assertion below.
    //
    // Every failure case also asserts the confidentiality property directly: a
    // sentinel in every observable field, and an assertion that none of it reaches
    // anything the answer carries. "The invocation was refused" is a weaker claim
    // than "the payload cannot be published", and only the second is the property.

//! Loading native NeMo Relay plugins: the loader and the host process's own end.
//!
//! This crate is the child's package. It opens a `cdylib` an operator approved,
//! checks the bytes against the approval, negotiates the ABI revision with the
//! plugin's entry symbol, installs the plugin's registrations through the
//! hosted-runtime seam, composes those registrations with a runtime configuration
//! as one activation transaction, and — in [`service`] — serves all of that to the
//! kernel over the boundary protocol. The binary it builds, `nemo-plugin-host`, is
//! the process the supervisor starts.
//!
//! It lives outside the kernel on purpose. Everything it needs from the kernel it
//! asks for through `nemo_relay::plugin::dynamic::NativeHostRuntime`, which is where
//! the decisions about registration ownership, invocation context, artifact
//! verification and compatibility live; the kernel, in turn, does not depend on this
//! crate, so a kernel process cannot link `dlopen` at all. The ABI it speaks is
//! `nemo-relay-native-abi`.
//!
//! The supervisor's own side of the protocol is `nemo-relay-plugin-host`: it holds
//! the modules both ends share — capabilities, codec handles, continuations,
//! operation scopes, the runtime service — and this crate depends on it for them.
//! The reverse edge is the one the architecture test forbids, because it is the one
//! that would put a loader in the kernel's process.
//!
//! Questions about what this crate may name inside the kernel are answered by the
//! seam's own tests in the kernel crate: the reach into the runtime is the
//! operations on that handle and nothing else.

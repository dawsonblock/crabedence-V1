//! Behaviour every plugin execution backend must share.
//!
//! The point of a seam is that implementations are interchangeable, and the
//! only way to know that is to run the same checks against each of them. The
//! in-process compatibility backend runs this suite first; the process backend
//! runs the identical suite when it exists, which is what will show that it
//! implements the contract rather than merely having methods with the same
//! names.
//!
//! The suite reports findings rather than asserting so a caller can decide what
//! to do with them, and so one backend's failure does not hide the others.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here: deadline enforcement. The kernel's
//! [`nemo_relay::plugin::execution::PluginManager`] refuses an expired deadline
//! before any backend is reached, so a backend cannot be asked to prove
//! something it is not responsible for. What a backend does when a deadline
//! passes mid-operation is part of the process backend's contract and is tested
//! where that implementation lives.

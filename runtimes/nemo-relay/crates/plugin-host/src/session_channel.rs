//! The host's end of the session channel.
//!
//! A plugin that wraps a streaming call pulls the stream the kernel is producing,
//! one chunk at a time, and it does that from inside a callback that is running in
//! this process. This is what stands between the two: a caller asks the kernel for
//! the downstream stream of one operation and gets back something it can poll, and
//! every poll is a message the kernel answers.
//!
//! Pacing is the point. The kernel produces the next chunk when it is asked for
//! one, so a plugin that stops pulling stops the work behind it — which is what an
//! in-process stream does too, and what makes the boundary invisible to the
//! callback rather than merely equivalent on average.
//!
//! One task per stream does the pulling, and the pollable value is that task's
//! output. Two reasons: a `poll_next` cannot await, and — more importantly — the
//! consumer dropping the stream has to reach the kernel as a cancellation rather
//! than as a host that stopped asking without saying so.
//!
//! Nothing on this side ends a stream except the kernel saying so. A session that
//! ends — the kernel dying, the transport breaking, a message the kernel refuses —
//! is a session that stopped serving the streams it was serving, and every one of
//! them fails with that rather than ending as if it had finished: a consumer must
//! not read "the kernel went away" as "the stream was complete".

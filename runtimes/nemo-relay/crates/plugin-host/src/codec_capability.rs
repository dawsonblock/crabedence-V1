//! Codec capabilities: what a plugin may use, for how long, and for what.
//!
//! An LLM sanitizer decides with the call's codec, and a codec is a live object the
//! runtime holds — it cannot cross a process boundary, and a plugin that could name any
//! codec it liked would be choosing how the runtime reads a payload rather than being
//! told. So a plugin is given a *reference* for the one invocation that has a codec
//! active, and the work is done on the side that holds the object, against a record this
//! side keeps.
//!
//! Three properties make the reference a capability rather than a name:
//!
//! - **Invocation binding.** A reference issued for operation A is not usable by
//!   operation B, even when both calls use the same codec. A codec is per call; a
//!   capability that outlived its call would be a way to use one call's authority while
//!   making another.
//! - **Direction binding.** A request codec and a response codec are different traits,
//!   so a reference for one direction is not a weaker reference for the other.
//! - **Identity binding.** The capability records which codec it was issued for, and the
//!   plugin's own request has to agree with it. A plugin cannot resolve a capability
//!   issued for the built-in chat codec and use it as if it were a runtime-registered
//!   one.
//!
//! Lifetime is a guard, not a convention. Issuing returns a [`CodecCapabilityGuard`]
//! beside the reference; when the invocation ends the guard drops and the record is
//! gone. A reference used afterwards is not "expired" in any interesting sense — it is
//! unknown, because nothing remembers it, and remembering every reference this process
//! ever forgot would be a leak in exchange for a better error message.
//!
//! This mirrors the worker subsystem, which solved the same problem in the same shape
//! (`WorkerCodecCapability` and its guard, `codec-<uuid>` references, invocation and
//! direction checks) for the worker transport. The invariants are deliberately the same
//! ones; only the side that holds the object differs.

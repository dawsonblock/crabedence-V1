//! The kernel-side proxies for a plugin's registrations.
//!
//! A host process holds a plugin's registrations; the kernel holds none of them,
//! because the callbacks live where the library is loaded. What the kernel
//! installs instead is one proxy per registration, at the priority the plugin
//! declared, under the identity the host reported — so a chain in the kernel
//! orders the plugin's registrations exactly where the plugin asked for them and
//! reaches each one through the seam.
//!
//! Only the classes the backend can serve are installed. A registration this
//! kernel cannot proxy is a registration that would silently not run, which is
//! what the activation's fail-closed check exists to prevent; reaching here with
//! one is refused rather than skipped.

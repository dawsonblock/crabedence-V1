//! The one activation path: what the CLI and every binding do to run plugins.
//!
//! There is a single lifecycle here on purpose. Four compositions that each
//! claimed a host, registered builtins, partitioned their plugins, activated
//! static components and rolled back after a failure would be four subtly
//! different activation semantics wearing one interface, and the differences
//! would show up as failures only one of them could reproduce. So the sequence
//! lives in one place, and the callers differ only in what they hand it: the
//! plugins to run, how a host is started, and what they want to check once the
//! process-hosted plugins are up.
//!
//! The invariant is the one a caller can rely on without knowing any of that:
//! `activate` returning `Ok` means every required component is live and owned by
//! the returned value, and `activate` returning `Err` means no partial
//! activation survives.
//!
//! What this owns is every lane: the static configuration, the process-hosted
//! native plugins, the worker plugins when this build carries that lane, the
//! process-wide ownership, and the rollback. A caller adds the parts only it can
//! know — where a host is, and what it wants checked once the native plugins are
//! up — and nothing else.

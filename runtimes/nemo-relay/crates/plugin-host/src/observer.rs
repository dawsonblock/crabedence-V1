//! Delivering this runtime's events to observers that live in another process.
//!
//! A subscriber in the host process watches this runtime's events. The runtime's
//! own dispatch calls subscribers synchronously, on the thread that delivers
//! every event to every observer, so a proxy that waited on an RPC there would
//! make one plugin's latency everyone's. Delivery is therefore queued and
//! performed by a task of its own, and three rules are what the queue exists to
//! keep.
//!
//! **An observer is never fatal.** A delivery that fails is recorded and stops
//! there. This is not a new rule: the in-process dispatcher already catches a
//! panicking subscriber and logs it, because an observer watches work rather than
//! permitting it. The record is a mark in this runtime's own stream, so a failure
//! cannot be silent just because it was harmless.
//!
//! **An observer is bounded, explicitly.** A delivery runs under the observer
//! budget the runtime states, and a runtime that states none cannot have remote
//! observers at all — the alternative to a stated limit is an invented one.
//!
//! **A full queue drops, loudly.** Blocking the dispatcher until a plugin caught
//! up would put that plugin in the runtime's event path; a drop is recorded once
//! per saturation rather than once per event, so the record cannot become the
//! flood it is reporting.

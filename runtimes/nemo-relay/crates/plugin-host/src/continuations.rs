//! The continuations a kernel holds for the plugin that asked for them.
//!
//! An execution intercept wraps the call it intercepts: the plugin decides
//! *when* the rest of the chain runs, and the rest of the chain is the kernel's.
//! A plugin in another process cannot reach it by calling anything local, so the
//! kernel holds the continuation while the plugin's callback runs, keyed by the
//! operation the callback belongs to, and runs it when the host asks.
//!
//! Held, not lent: the entry is removed when the intercept that owns it settles,
//! so a continuation that arrives afterwards is refused rather than run against
//! a chain position whose call has already returned. The continuation itself
//! carries the engine's own lease as well — a call still in flight when the
//! intercept settles is cancelled — so the rules a plugin sees are the ones an
//! in-process intercept sees, enforced on both sides of the boundary.
//!
//! Which family a position belongs to travels in the entry rather than on the
//! wire: one operation is one chain position, and the request that resumes it
//! carries only the input the plugin settled on. The wire is therefore the same
//! unary shape for every family that has one, and a request shaped for the wrong
//! family is refused by the entry it addresses rather than by a discriminator it
//! could get wrong.

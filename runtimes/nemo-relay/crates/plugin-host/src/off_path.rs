//! A runtime for the work a plugin does *beside* a call.
//!
//! Observers and sanitizers are invoked from the runtime's dispatcher, off the
//! task that made the call. The thread that would answer them is often the thread
//! that is waiting for them — on a single-threaded caller runtime it always is —
//! and an answer that can only arrive on a thread the caller is holding is a
//! deadlock that ends at the budget. That was the sanitizer hang: 5 s took 16 s,
//! 60 s took 181 s, and the events arrived with their observability fields
//! cleared, because a guardrail that never answered is a guardrail that failed.
//!
//! So the work gets a runtime of its own, owned by the composition rather than by
//! whichever runtime happened to call in. Three properties follow, and each is
//! why this is a resource rather than a helper:
//!
//! - **The caller's topology stops mattering.** A single-threaded caller is
//!   served exactly as a multi-threaded one, because neither thread is asked to
//!   answer work it is waiting for.
//! - **Affinity is deterministic.** The runtime that drives the transport is the
//!   runtime that awaits it, rather than whichever executor context the
//!   dispatcher happened to be running on.
//! - **Concurrency is bounded and stated.** An event-heavy workload cannot turn
//!   the off-path path into an unbounded queue; the bound is configuration, and
//!   saturation fails closed per family instead of blocking the call that is
//!   being observed.

//! The kernel's side of the duplex session.
//!
//! Most of what crosses this boundary is one request and one answer. A stream is
//! not: the plugin opens a downstream stream, pulls it one chunk at a time, and
//! may cancel or release it while a pull is outstanding — so its pace is the
//! plugin's, and the kernel's work behind it advances only when the plugin asks.
//! That is what the session channel carries, and this is what turns its messages
//! into the kernel's own actions.
//!
//! Two responsibilities, deliberately kept apart. `session.rs` decides what a
//! message may mean and when it may mean it — a pull for a stream that is not
//! open, a second pull while one is outstanding, a chunk answered twice. This
//! decides what the kernel *does*: call the provider chain the plugin is
//! wrapping, produce the next item, and stop producing when the plugin stops
//! asking. A driver that made its own decisions would be a second answer to the
//! same question, and the two would drift.
//!
//! What this must never do is wait on a producer. A dispatcher that awaited
//! `poll_next` would let one plugin's unresponsive provider decide whether any
//! other stream — or the cancellation of its own — is served, and a peer can hold
//! an unresponsive provider for as long as it likes. So the dispatcher routes and
//! never produces: every stream is owned by an actor of its own, the actor owns
//! the producer, and what the actor produces reaches the plugin through the
//! session's writer rather than through the dispatcher.
//!
//! The invariants this rests on, in the order they are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **The dispatcher never awaits a producer.** `SessionDriver::handle` has no
//!    `await` in it at all. It validates a message against the session's own
//!    record and routes it; everything that can block happens inside an actor.
//! 2. **One actor per stream, and the actor is the only owner of its producer.**
//!    The stream's lifecycle, the pull being produced for, and the identity of
//!    the next pull are the actor's fields, so no other task can observe a
//!    half-transitioned stream or produce for it.
//! 3. **One outstanding pull per stream.** The session's record refuses a second
//!    pull while one is outstanding, before the message can be routed, so an
//!    actor never has two polls in flight and a result is never ambiguous.
//! 4. **Every pull has an identity, and a result is accepted only for the pull it
//!    was produced for.** The session records a result only for the call the
//!    stream is still waiting for. A result that arrives for a pull a
//!    cancellation already settled is *stale* — it belongs to a call nobody is
//!    waiting for — so it is discarded rather than answered or refused.
//! 5. **Cancellation settles the stream, not the producer's cooperation.** A
//!    cancellation drops the outstanding poll future and then the producer. A
//!    producer that is parked forever is cancelled by being dropped, not by
//!    being asked to notice.
//! 6. **Actors are bounded.** One actor owns at most one outstanding poll, so the
//!    ceiling on actors is the ceiling on concurrent producing work; opens in
//!    flight are bounded on their own, because an open runs a chain rather than a
//!    poll.
//! 7. **A producer's panic fails its stream, not the session.** Panics from
//!    plugin code are contained: the stream settles with what happened, its
//!    producer is dropped, and the session keeps serving its other streams.
//! 8. **Order is the transport's, and it is enough.** One actor, one producer and
//!    at most one outstanding pull per stream means the frames of a stream cannot
//!    be interleaved or reordered by this side: they reach the plugin in the order
//!    the session recorded them. Explicit frame sequence numbers would be needed
//!    only if a stream ever had more than one producer, or if a transport could
//!    deliver one stream's frames out of order — neither of which is true here.
//! 9. **Demand is credit, and credit is granted by demand rather than ahead of it.**
//!    A pull grants one frame's worth and never more, so a stream nobody has asked
//!    about is not polled at all: a stream costs the session its consumer's
//!    appetite, not its producer's willingness to run ahead. One pull at a time is
//!    the strongest demand the protocol can express, which is why the grant is one.
//! 10. **Every frame is measured, and the ceilings are the session's.** What a
//!     stream sends is what it costs: the frame that opens it, its data, the failure
//!     that ends it and the terminal frame are each measured against the session's
//!     frame, byte and frame-count ceilings before they cross, and a frame that
//!     would cross one is not sent — the stream is over instead, and so is the work
//!     behind it.
//! 11. **A stream may not outlive the call it belongs to.** The deadline is the
//!     operation's, taken from the budget the chain position was parked under, and
//!     it is enforced whether or not anyone is asking: an idle stream is over when
//!     its call's time is up and its producer goes with it, an open still blocked at
//!     the deadline never becomes a stream, and a pull whose producer is still
//!     working at the deadline is answered with the deadline rather than with a
//!     frame. What ended the stream is held for the next pull when nothing was
//!     outstanding — a stream's frames are answers to demand, and the ending is one
//!     of them.
//!
//! What the streaming increment still owes is the mark-attribution matrix and the
//! last of the death phases, not more of this session: the mark window now follows
//! execution across the plugin's own task boundary — the SDK's side of the ABI,
//! with the session carrying the resulting marks like any other frame — and
//! everything else the class owed is here and asserted: the deadline, the ceilings,
//! the terminal rule, and the shutdown that drops every producer, with the mixture
//! run rather than argued in
//! `streams_that_end_every_way_at_once_leave_nothing_behind`. The class is not
//! served until the matrix lands, so nothing depends on the actor's shape yet.

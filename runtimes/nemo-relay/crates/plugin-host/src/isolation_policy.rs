//! How much a host process is contained, and what has to exist before it starts.
//!
//! Process separation is the first bound and it is already here: a plugin that
//! crashes or hangs takes its host down rather than the kernel's process, and the
//! supervisor kills what it started. What separation does *not* do is bound what
//! a plugin may read, write or connect to — the host inherits the kernel's
//! ambient authority, which means a plugin's code does too.
//!
//! The levels below are the deployment's statement about that. They are explicit
//! rather than automatic, because a runtime that silently confined a plugin that
//! needs a network connection would break working installations, and a runtime
//! that silently *did not* confine one whose deployment asked for it would be
//! worse than either: the configuration would describe a boundary that is not
//! there. Selecting a level this build cannot deliver is therefore a failure to
//! start, which is the same rule the resource limits follow.
//!
//! Third level, deliberately not a variant: a VM boundary for code assumed
//! hostile. It is a different mechanism with a different host image, and a
//! variant nothing can honor would read as a feature.

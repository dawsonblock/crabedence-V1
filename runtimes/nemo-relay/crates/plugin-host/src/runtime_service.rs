//! The kernel's side of the boundary: what a running plugin's host calls back.
//!
//! The forward direction is the kernel asking the host for lifecycle operations.
//! This is the other one: a native plugin runs in another process, and its host
//! functions — emitting a mark, reading the scope stack, resolving a codec — have
//! to reach *this* runtime, because a mark a plugin emits belongs to the kernel's
//! event stream and not to the child's copy of it.
//!
//! The service is per session, on a socket inside the directory the supervisor
//! already owns. The kernel serves one session per listener, so the session is a
//! property of the listener rather than a value a caller chooses, and the
//! credential the child was given out of band is what makes a caller the host of
//! that session. Knowing the path is not enough here either.
//!
//! Refusals are transport statuses rather than structured outcomes: the answer to
//! an emitted mark is an empty acknowledgement, so a refused operation has no
//! message to carry the refusal, and inventing one would be a second vocabulary
//! for facts the status already names.

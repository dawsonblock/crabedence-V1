//! Keeps native loading inside the one place it is allowed to be.
//!
//! The plugin-isolation milestone exists to move dynamic library loading out of
//! the kernel process. Until that happens the loader is still there, so the risk
//! is not the existing code — it is new code that quietly joins it. This test
//! makes that visible immediately rather than at the end of the milestone, when
//! the count would only be larger.
//!
//! Grandfathering is by path and is deliberately narrow. Removing an entry is
//! expected as the loader moves; adding one is the thing this test exists to
//! make a decision rather than an accident.
//!
//! The crate list is read from the workspace manifest rather than written here,
//! because a hand-written list is a list someone has to remember to extend: a new
//! crate that loads a library would be invisible until somebody noticed. The
//! dependency checks close the other half — a crate can reach the loader without
//! naming it, by depending on the crate that owns it.
//!
//! The same reasoning covers time. A budget belongs to an invocation and comes
//! from the runtime, so a duration written into the plugin-execution path is a
//! deadline somebody chose there — the shape the audit found as a `30_000`
//! constant. That check is source-level because the mistake is legible there: a
//! number in these files reads as policy whether or not it reaches a caller.

/// The registration classes the boundary serves today, and the ones it does not.
///
/// This was the number that gated the migration, and the gate is open: every
/// class the ABI exposes is served, so the single entry left in
/// [`INDIRECT_LOAD_CALLERS`] waits on its own cutover rather than on coverage.
/// The list is kept as an equality rather than a subset precisely because that
/// is now a statement about completeness — a class added to the ABI has to be
/// served or named here, and the test is what makes that a decision.
///
/// The test is written as an equality rather than a subset so that growth is a
/// decision with a diff, and as two lists so that the gap is visible rather than
/// implied. The first entry to move was the tool execution intercept: the class
/// that wraps a call, which needed the kernel to hold a suspended chain position
/// and resume it when the host asked. The last, so far, is the LLM stream execution
/// intercept: the class whose answer is a stream, which needed the duplex session, a
/// kernel that routes instead of producing, and the mark window that follows
/// execution across the plugin's own task — all of it qualified before it was
/// advertised.
///
/// The last three to move are the event sanitizers — mark, scope start, scope end —
/// and they moved together because they are one shape: a *projection* goes down (the
/// name a sanitizer decides on, the phase when it is a scope event, and the mutable
/// fields it may change) and the fields come back, so the class, the registration and
/// the event's identity stay the kernel's. What each one needed was a proxy, a
/// host-side runner and a core door that runs exactly the registration the kernel
/// names, and all three were qualified through a real child before this list grew.
///
/// The one after them is the LLM request sanitizer, and it is the class the codec
/// capability protocol exists for: a sanitizer is given the call's codec, a codec is a live
/// object this side holds, so the plugin is sent the identity it decides with and a
/// reference the kernel checks, and the work happens where the object is. It joined this
/// list after a real child resolved the kernel's codec through that reference.

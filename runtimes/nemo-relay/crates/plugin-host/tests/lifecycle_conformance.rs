//! `process_backend.rs` runs the same checks against a child. The two files
//! together are the claim that lifecycles do not depend on which backend was
//! composed: load, reload and unload have to refuse the same requests with the
//! same codes on both sides of the boundary, and a suite that only ran against
//! one of them would be checking an implementation rather than a contract.
//!
//! Both suites are the same code — `conformance::check` and
//! `conformance::check_lifecycle` — so a case added for one backend is
//! immediately a case for the other.

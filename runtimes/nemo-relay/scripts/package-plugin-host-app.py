"""Package the plugin host as a macOS application bundle and sign it ad hoc.

macOS applies App Sandbox through the entitlements a *signed bundle* carries. A
bare Mach-O that claims `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` is refused at launch —
the entitlement is in the signature but there is no bundle for the system to
create a container from — so confinement is not a property a flag can add to the
executable this repository already builds. It is a second packaging step, and
this is it.

What the bundle is for:

* the executable lives at `Contents/MacOS/nemo-plugin-host`, which is the layout
  `crates/plugin-host` resolves and the layout whose signature the system reads;
* `Contents/Info.plist` gives the bundle an identifier, which is what names the
  container the host is allowed to write;
* the entitlements come from `security/entitlements/`, and the strict variant is
  the default: the weaker one exists for plugins signed by someone else and is
  chosen explicitly.

Signing here is ad hoc (`codesign --sign -`). That is what makes the *security
architecture* implementable and testable on a machine with no Apple certificate,
and it is not a distribution story: an ad-hoc signature is not notarizable and
not accepted for a downloaded artifact, so shipping this to users still needs a
Developer ID and a notarization step in CI.

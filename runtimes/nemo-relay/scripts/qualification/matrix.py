"""Check that every claim a milestone makes names what enforces it.

A milestone document says things like "the boundary serves every registration
class" and "a hung host is killed at the deadline". Those sentences are checked by
tests, and the sentences and the tests drift apart in the ordinary way: a test is
renamed, moved behind a feature flag, or deleted, and the document goes on saying
what it said. Nothing about reading either one shows the drift.

``security/qualification-matrix.toml`` is where each claim names the test, recipe or
script that enforces it, and this gate resolves every name against the tree. What it
enforces, and why:

* **A name resolves exactly once.** Two tests sharing a name are two facts wearing
  one label. Evidence that cannot be pointed at is not evidence.
* **An enforced claim has evidence.** A claim with none is an assertion, and the
  policy file has a section for those: they are recorded as unverified, with the why.
* **The generated document matches.** ``security/QUALIFICATION-MATRIX.md`` is
  rendered from the policy file, so a claim that was edited without regenerating it
  is a difference this gate can see.
* **The lanes a claim depends on still run it.** A claim enforced by a recipe is
  enforced by CI only if a workflow invokes that recipe, and a lane only runs when
  the paths that can invalidate it are filtered to it. Both halves are checked here:
  the ``workflow`` evidence kind resolves a recipe against the workflows that call
  it, and ``filter_problems`` refuses a tree where a change to the plugin isolation
  boundary would leave a lane that installs an artifact skipped.

Which is the whole point: renaming or deleting a test turns the gate red, rather
than leaving a table that still reads as if it were true.

"""Probe App Sandbox behavior using a purpose-built bundled executable.

The restricted policy hands a plugin host to App Sandbox. What makes that a
security boundary rather than a claim is that the operations a plugin must not
perform *fail*, and that the operations it must perform still work: a host that
cannot stage an approved artifact is not confined, it is broken, and a host that
can write `/tmp` or read the account's home is not confined at all.

This checks the sandbox contract on a real machine:

* the probe bundle carries the sandbox entitlement, launches, gets a container,
  and the container is writable where the host stages;
* shared temporary storage, the account's home, outbound
  network and a library outside the container are all refused.

The supplied release host path is checked to ensure the release artifact exists,
but this executable is a focused probe rather than the host itself. The separate
opt-in process-backend test combines a signed host bundle with artifact transfer
and load; it currently documents the temporary-socket denial and must pass after
the IPC transport is changed before restricted mode can be enabled.

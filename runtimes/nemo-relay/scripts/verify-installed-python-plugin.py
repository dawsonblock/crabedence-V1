"""Prove an installed Python artifact runs a native plugin, or says why it cannot.

The distribution question this answers is not "does the package import" but "can
the thing a deployment installs do the work": a wheel carries the plugin host and
must run a native plugin out of process, and a source install carries no host and
must fail with the message that says where one was looked for rather than falling
back to loading plugin code in process.

Run against any interpreter the artifact was installed into. The plugin fixture
and the manifest are built here, so the check exercises the installed runtime
rather than anything from the checkout.

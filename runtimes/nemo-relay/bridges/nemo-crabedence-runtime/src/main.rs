//! The NEMO effect runtime: one process that routes capability invocations
//! through the verified registry.
//!
//! This is the composition layer the transfer's architecture calls for. NeMo
//! Relay's own kernel cannot carry consequential execution — its authority path
//! either refuses or requires NeMo Relay to hold authority it must not hold
//! (finding 6 in `docs/plan/nemo-runtime-transfer.md`) — so the router sits
//! above it, and this binary is that router as a running instance rather than a
//! library under test.
//!
//! What it does, in the frozen order the integration-closure plan fixes:
//!
//! 1. verifies the registry envelope next to the socket, and fails closed if it
//!    does not match its digest;
//! 2. resolves the capability's class and route **from that registry**, never
//!    from the caller, and fixes the pre-middleware identity — the immutable
//!    facts a plugin can observe but not alter;
//! 3. runs the managed middleware chain — plugins may inspect, deny, or rewrite
//!    the arguments, and nothing else;
//! 4. binds the effective arguments the chain delivered — the original and
//!    effective digests, the active middleware set, and the consequential
//!    idempotency identity — into the request the router sees;
//! 5. routes through `EffectRouter`: `LOCAL` executes through the function-hook
//!    backend, `CRABEDENCE` crosses the kernel, `DIRECT` fails closed until a
//!    read path is wired.
//!
//! A managed call that never reaches the routed dispatch — middleware answered
//! it instead — is refused: a capability result that did not cross the router
//! is not evidence of execution.
//!
//! It can also host a real native plugin (`--plugin`): the host is started as a
//! process under the deployment's resolved isolation policy, the artifact is
//! loaded and activated through it, and the registrations are proxied into this
//! process's chains, where they mediate the managed invocation. With
//! `--capability` the plugin composes into that invocation's chain; without
//! one, the standalone host mode runs an optional tool probe instead.
//!
//! What this binary never does is offer a plugin an effect protocol: a
//! plugin's registrations are middleware and observability, so a plugin may
//! mediate an invocation the runtime already chose and can never name a
//! capability, class, route, authority, principal, or identity. See the
//! integration-closure section of `docs/plan/nemo-runtime-transfer.md`.
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//! ```text
//! nemo-crabedence-runtime --capability <id> [--arguments <json>] [--principal <id>]
//!                         [--grant <authority-ref>] [--idempotency-key <key>]
//!                         [--socket <path>] [--snapshot <path>]
//!                         [--plugin <manifest-or-dir> --plugin-id <id> --component <kind>]
//!
//! nemo-crabedence-runtime --plugin <manifest-or-dir> --plugin-id <id>
//!                         --component <kind> [--tool <name>] [--arguments <json>]
//! ```
//!
//! `--idempotency-key` is required for `MUTATION` and `CRITICAL` capabilities.
//! It is the caller's logical-action key: stable across retries of one action,
//! unique across distinct actions. The runtime namespaces it per principal —
//! the same construction the kernel applies — so two principals cannot collide
//! on one key, and a capability-derived default, which would name every
//! invocation the same operation, is refused.
//!
//! The outcome is printed as JSON on stdout: `{"status": "SUCCEEDED", ...}` or
//! `{"status": "FAILED", "code": ..., "retryable": ..., ...}`, with `UNKNOWN`
//! kept distinct because it must never be retried.

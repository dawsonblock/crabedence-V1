# Exercise the expired-authority scenario against a real service.
#
# The NEMO integration's live suite covers the refusals the kernel makes at
# admission. Expired authority is the one that cannot be asserted in place: the
# issuing tool refuses to mint a grant whose expiry is already in the past, so
# the reference has to be issued with a short future expiry and then allowed to
# lapse. That timing lives here, where it is explicit and bounded, rather than
# inside the Rust test — a test that slept on a clock would be flaky and slow.
#
# The assertion itself is the ordinary live suite:
#
#   refuses_an_expired_authority_reference
#
# Usage: scripts/test-nemo-expired-authority.sh [--ttl-seconds N]

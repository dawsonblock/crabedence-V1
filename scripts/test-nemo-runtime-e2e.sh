# Exercise the runtime instance end to end, against a live service.

# The bridge has live coverage (`tests/live_socket.rs`) and the router has its
# own tests; what had none is the binary that composes them,
# `nemo-crabedence-runtime` — the process a caller actually runs. Its
# invocation-identity policy is only observable through it: a MUTATION or
# CRITICAL invocation without a caller-supplied idempotency key must be refused
# before dispatch, and one key must replay rather than duplicate.
#
# This script starts a real `serve-exec`, issues a real grant, and drives the
# real binary:
#
#   PURE                      → routed locally, no socket hop
#   MUTATION without a key    → refused before dispatch, exit 2
#   MUTATION with grant + key → committed with evidence
#   the same key again        → replayed, exactly one effect
#   MUTATION without a grant  → UNAUTHORIZED, definitive and non-retryable
#   unregistered capability   → refused before any socket hop
